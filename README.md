# University-Suggestion-Application
Uses a weighting-based algorithm to determine which university in Ontario you should apply to. This application is strictly for STEM programs.
University information was taken from myblueprint.ca.
This application should be run in the Eclipse IDE, but can be run in other environments by taking the raw .java files from the .zip.
